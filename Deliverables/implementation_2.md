## 1. Introduction
EasyCart is a free, accessible web application made to help people create nice meals without the hassle of trying to find a specific recipe and what ingredients they need to pick up. Taking the time to create a shopping list can be time consuming in the working world where time is money. When it comes to groceries, staying healthy while saving time can be difficult, but there is an easier way to save time and reach your goals with EasyCart.

EasyCart works by using Spoonacular’s API to search through Target’s API to find the ingredients needed for a chosen recipe. First the user searches for a recipe on EasyCart’s website, they choose a recipe that is appealing to them, then they can add the ingredients to their cart. This streamlines the experience of recipe making into a few simple steps, in order to facilitate ease in creating the recipe one loves.
